## üîç What it Detects

FakeModBlocker detects **clients or mods that register known plugin message channels**, such as:

- `fml:hs` ‚Üí Forge
- `fabric:registry/sync` ‚Üí Fabric
- `xaeroworldmap` ‚Üí Xaeroworldmap mod
- Any custom channel you define

‚ö†Ô∏è **This plugin does NOT detect all mods or cheating tools.**  
It works only if the client uses plugin channels that can be monitored.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
> FakeModBlocker does **not** detect all mods or cheating tools. It only works if the client sends identifiable plugin messages.

This makes it ideal for detecting casual use of mod loaders, but it should **not be treated as an anti-cheat/mod solution!**

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Can this detect hacked clients like Sigma, Impact, or Aristois?
**A:** No. Those clients often avoid using detectable plugin message channels. This plugin is best used to detect **mod loaders** like Fabric, Forge, Lunar, etc.

### Q: Is this an anti-cheat?
**A:** No. This is a **mod presence detector**, not a cheat detection system.

### Q: How does it work?
**A:** It checks which `Plugin Message Channels` the player is listening on when they join. Many mod clients (e.g., Fabric/Forge) automatically register custom channels, which this plugin can detect and respond to.
